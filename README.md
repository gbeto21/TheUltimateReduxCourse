# ‚öõÔ∏è The Ultimate Redux Course
Repo from the Udemy Course [The Ultimate Redux Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-redux-course-state-management-library).

This course teaches you **"vanilla" Redux**, **Redux tool kit** and **React Redux** using two projects.

The <u>first project</u> is a simple web page that  doesn't show too much on the web site, but under the hood uses a javascript file that uses Redux.

The <u>second</u> project is a To Do React App that gets the todos from a small back end 

## Installing dependencies
You'll need to install the dependencies for each project, from the root foolder run the following commands:

To install the dependencies of the first project
```bash
npm i
```
To install the dependencies of the second project
```bash
cd todo-app/ && npm i
```
To install the dependencies of the backend project
```bash
cd src/backend && npm i
```

## Running the projects
